The UART-TTL (labeled as `RS485`) socket of the BMS can be attached to any UART pins of the ESP. A hardware UART should be preferred because of the high baudrate (115200 baud). The connector is called 4 Pin JST with 1.25mm pitch.

## Installation

You can install this component with [ESPHome external components feature](https://esphome.io/components/external_components.html) like this:
```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://syssi/esphome-jk-bms@main
```

or just use the `esp32-example.yaml` as proof of concept:

```bash
# Install esphome
pip3 install esphome

# Clone this external component
git clone https://github.com/syssi/esphome-jk-bms.git
cd esphome-jk-bms

# Create a secrets.yaml containing some setup specific secrets
cat > secrets.yaml <<EOF
wifi_ssid: MY_WIFI_SSID
wifi_password: MY_WIFI_PASSWORD

mqtt_host: MY_MQTT_HOST
mqtt_username: MY_MQTT_USERNAME
mqtt_password: MY_MQTT_PASSWORD
EOF

# Validate the configuration, create a binary, upload it, and start logs
# If you use a esp8266 run the esp8266-example.yaml
esphome run esp32-example.yaml

```

## Known issues

* The battery type sensor is pretty useless because the BMS reports always the same value (`Ternary Lithium`). Regardless of which battery type was set / parameter set was loaded via the android app. ([#9][i9])
* ESP32: Adding all supported sensors can lead to a stack overflow / boot loop. This can be solved by increasing the stack size. ([#63][i63])

## Debugging

If this component doesn't work out of the box for your device please update your configuration to enable the debug output of the UART component and increase the log level to the see outgoing and incoming serial traffic:

```
logger:
  level: DEBUG

uart:
  - id: uart_0
    baud_rate: 115200
    rx_buffer_size: 384
    tx_pin: ${tx_pin}
    rx_pin: ${rx_pin}
    debug:
      direction: BOTH
```
